        "\n",
        "If you wish to contribute to the content of this book, you need to modify the\n",

        "can modify notebooks in the md format directly in Jupyter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "First, install the notedown plugin, run the Jupyter Notebook, and load the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install d2l-notedown  # You may need to uninstall the original notedown.\n",
        "jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.contents_manager_class='notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You may also turn on the notedown plugin by default whenever you run the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "First, generate a Jupyter Notebook configuration file (if it has already been generated, you can skip this step).\n",

        "```\n",
        "jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
        "```\n",

        "c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = 'notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, you only need to run the `jupyter notebook` command to turn on the notedown plugin by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Remote Server\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to run Jupyter notebooks on a remote server and access it through a browser on your local computer. If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "ssh myserver -L 8888:localhost:8888\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n",
        "Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n",
        "later in this appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
        "jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "* Using the Jupyter Notebook tool, we can edit, run, and contribute to each section of the book.\n",
        "* We can run Jupyter notebooks on remote servers using port forwarding.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Exercises\n",
